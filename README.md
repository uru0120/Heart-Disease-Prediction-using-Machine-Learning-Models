# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Models
Developed a Heart Disease Prediction model using machine learning techniques to assess the likelihood of heart disease based on 13 attributes from the UCI repository dataset.

Conducted thorough data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training with a focus on popular algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes.

Demonstrated strong data analysis skills through exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and model evaluation, showcasing accuracy and performance metrics.

Technologies and Future Work:

Utilized Python, scikit-learn, and other relevant tools for implementation. Emphasized the importance of continuous improvement, suggesting future enhancements for the project.
